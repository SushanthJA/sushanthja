## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sushanth!

I'm a **Master's graduate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** from the **University of Birmingham**. My interests lie in researching and developing AI-driven solutions, particularly in **Computer Vision** and **NLP**.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Domain Specific Question Answering System using LLMs and RAG**.
- ðŸ›  I have recently developed an **image super-resolution** model with a UNet and residual blocks as part of my Mater's thesis, **analyzing the impact of different loss functions**. Check the research paper out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3rKlcT6vA-PURgD8ZMENdxeYbYR2ivL/view?usp=drive_link).
- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently learning **LLM Engineering: Developing and deploying AI agents** and **3D Vision**.

ðŸš€ Looking for opportunities in **AI/ML research and AI-driven product development**. Feel free to check out my work and connect!
